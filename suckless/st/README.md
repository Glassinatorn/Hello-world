# st - simple terminal
This is simply my configuration of the st terminal provided by the Suckless
group.


# Requirements
Nothing more than the basic requirements for default st is needed.


# Installation
Feel free to addd your own patches, but if you are satisfied with the ones I
have chosen, simply run 'make && sudo make install' to build and install st.

# Credits
Creds go to the Suckless group and the ones who havae made the patches I have
chosen to include.
